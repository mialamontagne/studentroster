# studentroster

This is a a text-based (system console) application created using C++.

It allows the user to input student data (ID, first and last name, age, days taken to complete courses, and degree program).

Various commands in the main.cpp will then call on various functions that manipulate and print students by different categories.

Student data can be printed by all students, or by specific degree program. Additionally, students with invalid emails can be printed to the console. The program can also calculate the average number of days it takes each student to complete a course, so long as they enter the required data.
